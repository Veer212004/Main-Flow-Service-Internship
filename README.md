MERN STACK TASK 1: Basic React
Application Development
âœ… Task Overview
This task involved creating a basic ReactJS application to develop a foundational
understanding of React development. It included setting up the project, exploring the file
structure, creating components, and understanding the development workflow.
âœ… Tools and Technologies Used
ï‚· ReactJS
ï‚· Node.js and npm
ï‚· VS Code
ï‚· Command Line / Terminal
âœ… 1. React Application Setup
âž¤ Command Used:
npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
âž¤ Initialization:
ï‚· Installed all required dependencies.
ï‚· Project structure auto-generated with core folders and files.
2. File and Folder Structure Explanation
File/Folder Purpose
src/ Contains main code: React components, styles, logic.
public/ Holds static files (e.g., index.html) â€“ entry point of the app.
File/Folder Purpose
node_modules/ Contains all npm packages. Auto-generated, should not be modified.
package.json Lists all dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
package-lock.json Ensures exact versions of dependencies are installed.
.gitignore Lists files/folders to exclude from Git (e.g., node_modules/).
README.md Contains instructions and documentation about the project.
3. Basic React Component Created
âž¤ Component: Greeting.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Greeting(props) {
 const [name, setName] = useState(props.name || "Guest");
 return (
 <div>
 <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
 <button onClick={() => setName("Veeresh")}>Change Name</button>
 </div>
 );
}
export default Greeting;
âž¤ Integration in App.js:
import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';
function App() {
 return (
 <div>
 <Greeting name="React Learner" />
 </div>
 );
}
export default App;
4. Development Workflow Observed
âž¤ Running the Development Server:
npm start
âž¤ Observations:
ï‚· Application runs at http://localhost:3000.
ï‚· Hot Reloading updates the browser view instantly after code changes.
ï‚· Debugging and testing made easier with real-time feedback.
5. Observations and Learnings
âœ… React Core Concepts:
ï‚· JSX: Used to write HTML-like syntax in JavaScript.
ï‚· Components: Created reusable Greeting component.
ï‚· Props: Passed dynamic data (name) to components.
ï‚· State (useState): Used to change and manage internal component data.
Challenges Faced:
ï‚· Forgetting to import the custom component in App.js.
ï‚· Initial confusion around file structure and where to place custom components.
Key Learnings:
ï‚· React follows a component-based architecture.
ï‚· Props and State help in making applications interactive and dynamic.
ï‚· Hot reload significantly improves development experience.
ï‚· Proper file structure understanding is essential for scaling larger projects.
